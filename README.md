### Project Description
This platform is designed for college students to report and reclaim lost items. Users must sign in to access features like submitting details of found items or browsing lost item listings, ensuring secure and organized tracking of belongings.
### The Probelem statement 
The "Lost and Found Website" addresses the persistent problem of misplaced or lost belongings in a college campus. Traditional methods like notice boards or word-of-mouth are inefficient, time-consuming, and lack proper tracking. This project provides a centralized, secure platform where students can easily report lost or found items, streamlining the process of recovering valuables and reducing frustration in such situations.
### The Solution
We're solving the chaos of lost items with a sleek, hassle-free website! Think of it as your digital Sherlock Holmesâ€”students log in, post about their lost or found items, and voilÃ ! The site connects the dots like a pro. No more scouring notice boards or asking around awkwardlyâ€”our platform keeps it simple, organized, and way cooler than old-school methods!
